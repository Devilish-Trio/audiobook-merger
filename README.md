This code is used to merge a list of audio files into a single file using the ffmpeg command-line utility. The code begins by allowing the user to select the input audio files using a file selection dialog. It then sets the output file's extension to be the same as the input file's extension.

Next, the code creates a text file called input_list.txt and writes a list of the input audio file paths to it, with the file directive preceding each file path. This text file is used as input to ffmpeg.

Finally, the code runs the ffmpeg command using the subprocess module, passing in the following arguments:

"-f": specifies the input format as concat, which allows ffmpeg to read a list of input files from a text file.
"-safe": sets the safe option to 0, which allows ffmpeg to read input files from paths specified in the input_list.txt file.
"-i": specifies the input file as input_list.txt.
"-vn": tells ffmpeg to ignore any video streams in the input files.
"-c:a": specifies the audio codec to use for the output file as libmp3lame.
"-q:a": sets the audio quality to 1 (highest quality) for the libmp3lame codec.
"-b:a": sets the audio bitrate to 128k for the output file.
output_file: specifies the path to the output file.
After the ffmpeg command has finished running, the code deletes the input_list.txt file and prints a success message.
